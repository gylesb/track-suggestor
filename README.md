# Track Suggester

To wrap up what we had learned during this week, we built a page using JavaScript and jQuery to gauge what track future Epicodus students should sign up for. Within the code we used branching and bootstrapping to make the page design look neat while also utilizing a disappearing well on the bottom to create a neat effect.
