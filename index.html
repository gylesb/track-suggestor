            <h2>Based off of your results, you'd be best suited for the <b>Java/Android</b> track!</h2>
            <h4><strong>Java</strong> is a favorite of enterprise companies, but its appeal is broader as well: it's one of the most popular of all programming languages, and it's used in everything from for high-performance processing to building Android user interfaces. Because <strong>Java</strong> has been very popular for a very long time and is used in so many applications, it is also a very high-demand language. If you're interested in working for an enterprise-level company, as an Android developer, or in high-performance applications, <strong>Java</strong> could be a good language to learn.</h4>

            <h4>If you're like some people out there, then you have some trouble with keeping pages looking simplistic. Front-end developers spend their time making things look and work well, obsessing over layouts, navigation, colors, and design. If this type of work appeals to you, your best bet is to take <strong>CSS and Design</strong> classes at Epicodus.</h4>

            <h2>Based off of your results, you'd be best suited for the <b>C#/.NET</b> track!</h2>
            <h4><strong>C#</strong> is most popular among bigger established businesses, often for building internal software. Because it's been around for a long time and has the backing of Microsoft, it is one of the most in-demand languages in the job market. <strong>C#</strong> has also been going through a bit of a rebirth lately, with Microsoft open sourcing the language and surrounding platform, porting it to run on Mac and Linux, and incorporating many of the best features of other languages. If you like the idea of working for a larger company on business software, <strong>C#</strong> is a great choice.</h4>
